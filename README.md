IMPACT OF DIFFERENT ECONOMIC INDICATORS ON STOCK MARKET

With the goal of practicing the use of APIs and web scraping, as well as data cleaning and analysis, we have designed a small exploratory project.

The project involves analyzing the impact of various economic indicators on the U.S. stock market, specifically focusing on 11 selected ETFs:

-  SPY : S&P 500
-  XLK: Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund
-  XLV: Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund
-  XLF: Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund
-  XLY: Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund
-  XLP: Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund
-  XLE: Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund
-  XLI: Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund
-  XLB: Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund
-  XLU: Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund
-  XLRE: Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund

To accomplish this, we used the APIs of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Yahoo Finance.

Initial Hypotheses:

1. Impact of Economic Growth on Stock Market Returns
High GDP growth rates are positively correlated with stock market returns, while low or negative GDP growth rates correlate with stock market declines.

2. Inflation and Stock Market Valuation
Periods of high inflation are associated with lower stock market returns due to decreased purchasing power and increased input costs.

3. Interest Rates and Stock Market Movements
Rising interest rates are negatively correlated with stock market performance, as higher borrowing costs reduce corporate profits and consumer spending.

4. Unemployment and Market Sentiment
High unemployment rates are associated with bearish stock market trends, as they reflect economic slowdown and reduced consumer spending.

5. Consumer Confidence and Stock Market Returns
Higher Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) values are positively correlated with stock market returns, as optimism leads to higher consumer spending and investment.

6. Industrial Production and Stock Market Cycles
Increases in industrial production rates are positively correlated with stock market returns, while declines are correlated with bearish market trends.

PROYECT CONCLUSIONS
1. GDP Growth Impact on Market Returns
  - Financial and consumer staples sectors show stronger correlations with GDP growth, indicating economic sensitivity.
  - Sectors like technology and healthcare have weaker correlations, suggesting less reliance on economic growth.

2. inflation and Market Returns
  - Inflation generally has a weak negative impact across sectors, with consumer discretionary showing slight sensitivity.
  - Technology and utilities appear less affected by inflation, indicating potential stability during inflationary periods.

3. Interest Rate Impact on Market Returns
  - Financial, health care and real state sectors show stronger correlations with interest rates.
  - Sectors like public services and consumer staples have weaker correlations.

4. Unemployment Rate and Market Returns
  - Unemployment generally has a weak negative impact across Technology, Energy and Real State sectors.
  - Consumer staples and public services appear less affected by unemployment.

5. Customer Sentiment Index and Market Returns
  - The Consumer Confidence Index growth rate does not significantly impact or explain these ETFs returns in isolation.
  - In addition, the Consumer Confidence Index could be reacting with a delay to changes ocurring in the market, so also showing movements lagging behind those of the capital markets.

6. Industrial Production Index and Market Returns
  - Not significative correlation found between IPI and ETFs returns. The IPI and stock market operate on slightly different timelines, with the stock market often acting as a leading indicator and the IPI reflecting current industrial conditions.
